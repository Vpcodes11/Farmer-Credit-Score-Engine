Farmer Credit Score Engine: Transparent Rural Lending Through Data

THE PROBLEM

India's 146 million farmers face a persistent credit gap. Traditional credit scoring fails rural borrowers because:

• Lack of formal credit history (70% of farmers are unbanked)
• Seasonal, unpredictable income tied to crop cycles
• Banks rely on collateral, not creditworthiness
• Opaque scoring creates distrust and limits access

Result: ₹8 trillion credit gap, forcing farmers to informal lenders at 24-36% interest rates.

THE SOLUTION

The Farmer Credit Score Engine is a transparent, data-driven platform that computes credit scores (0-100) for farmers using:

1. Agri Stack Integration: Land records, crop registry, and farmer profiles from government databases
2. Satellite Imagery: Real-time crop health monitoring via NDVI (vegetation index)
3. Weather Data: Rainfall patterns and anomalies affecting yields
4. Alternative Data: UPI transactions, FPO membership, market access

Our scoring model combines 11 features with explainable AI (SHAP) to provide farmers and banks with the top 3 drivers behind each score—in plain language.

Example: "Score: 74. Drivers: (1) Strong crop health from satellite, (2) Clean credit history, (3) Active digital transactions."

WHY IT WORKS

Transparency: Farmers see exactly why they got their score and how to improve it.
Accuracy: Satellite + weather data capture real-time farm performance, not just past defaults.
Flexibility: Loan EMI plans align with crop cycles (4-6 months), not rigid monthly schedules.
Scale: Cloud-native microservices handle millions of farmers with sub-second scoring.

TECHNOLOGY STACK

• Backend: FastAPI (Python) for REST APIs, Celery for background jobs
• ML Model: RandomForest with SHAP explainability (70%+ test accuracy)
• Frontend: React PWA with offline-first capability for rural connectivity
• Infrastructure: Docker + Kubernetes for production deployment
• CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

PILOT DEPLOYMENT

Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Partner with one regional rural bank (RRB) in Punjab
• Onboard 1,000 wheat farmers
• Integrate with Agri Stack sandbox
• Deploy on bank's private cloud (AKS/EKS)

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Expand to 10,000 farmers across 3 states
• Add rice and cotton crops
• Integrate real satellite data (Sentinel-2 via Google Earth Engine)
• Train bank loan officers on platform

Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Scale to 100,000 farmers
• Partner with 5 RRBs and 2 cooperative banks
• Launch mobile app for field agents
• Implement automated loan approvals for high-score farmers

BUSINESS MODEL

• SaaS Licensing: ₹50/farmer/year for banks
• Transaction Fee: 0.5% of loan amount for automated approvals
• Data Services: Anonymized insights to agri-input companies

TARGET MARKET

• 38 Regional Rural Banks in India
• 1,482 Cooperative Banks
• 10+ Fintech lenders (Samunnati, DeHaat, AgroStar)

IMPACT METRICS (Year 1)

• 100,000 farmers scored
• ₹500 crore in loans disbursed
• 15% reduction in default rates (vs. traditional scoring)
• 30% faster loan approvals (from 14 days to 10 days)

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Unlike generic credit bureaus (CIBIL, Experian), we:
1. Use real-time farm data (satellite, weather), not just historical defaults
2. Provide explainability (SHAP drivers), building farmer trust
3. Align repayment with crop cycles, reducing defaults
4. Offer offline-capable tools for rural field agents

TEAM & EXPERTISE

• ML Engineer: 5+ years in agri-tech, built crop yield models
• Backend Engineer: Ex-fintech, scaled APIs to 10M users
• Product Manager: Domain expert in rural finance, worked with NABARD

CALL TO ACTION

We're seeking pilot partners (banks) and technical validation. Our prototype is production-ready:
• Full API with 15+ endpoints
• Synthetic data for 200 farmers (expandable)
• Docker Compose for local testing
• Kubernetes manifests for cloud deployment

Next Steps:
1. Demo with your team (15 minutes)
2. Sandbox integration with Agri Stack
3. Pilot agreement with one RRB (3-month trial)

Transparent credit scoring isn't just better for farmers—it's better for banks. Lower defaults, faster approvals, and deeper rural penetration.

Let's close the credit gap together.
